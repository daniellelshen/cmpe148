## HW2 - Webserver Lab

In this lab, you will learn the basics of socket programming for TCP connections in Python: how to create
a socket, bind it to a specific address and port, as well as send and receive a HTTP packet. You will also
learn some basics of HTTP header format.

## HW 3 - SMTP Lab

Your task is to develop a simple mail client that sends email to any recipient. Your client will need to
connect to a mail server, dialogue with the mail server using the SMTP protocol, and send an email
message to the mail server. Python provides a module, called smtplib, which has built in methods to send
mail using SMTP protocol. However, we will not be using this module in this lab, because it hide the
details of SMTP and socket programming.

## HW5 - ICMP Ping Lab
